Uploading of image files is a common feature among software applications. Since it is so common, a developer must not only know how to select an image from the system's file dialog, he/she must also be able to display a preview of what the app user is trying to upload. In this post, we'll create a simple custom React hook for providing an image preview.

## The markup

First, let us render a simple markup.

```tsx title="ImagePreview.tsx" showLineNumbers
const ImagePreview = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: '300px' }}>
      <div style={{ aspectRatio: '4 / 3', backgroundColor: 'silver', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
        {/* the <img /> goes here */}
      </div>
      <input type='file' accept='image/*' aria-label='Upload image' />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now there's much here. First, we're using HTML5's `input` with a type as `file`. We are also constraining the user to only pick images from the system file dialog by providing `accept='image/*'`. Above the input is a container within which is an `img` element. We are providing a definite aspect-ratio to the container. Note that using aspect ratio is important to avoid layout shifts. One final thing to note is that the reason why we're just using `style` to give styles to our markup is that this is just an example component.

The markup is rendered like this:

## Adding state and handler

Now let us add the component's state and the change handler

```tsx title="ImagePreview.tsx" showLineNumbers {4, 6-11, 16-24}
import * as React from 'react';

const ImagePreview = () => {
  const [imageFile, setImageFile] = React.useState<File | null>(null);

  const handleChange: React.ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement> = (e) => {
    const files = e.target.files;
    if (!files || !files.item(0)) return;

    setImageFile(files.item(0));
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '300px' }}>
      <div style={{ aspectRatio: '4 / 3', backgroundColor: 'silver', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
        {imageFile && (
          <img
            src=''
            alt='a sample preview'
            width='100%'
            height='100%'
            style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}
          />
        )}
      </div>
      <input type='file' accept='image/*' aria-label='Upload image' onChange={handleChange} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Our state will hold the image file that the user picks. Initially it is null that's why at line 16, we are conditionally rendering the image component based on whether `imageFile` is truthy or not. As for the image styles, providing a `width` and `height` attribute as 100% assures us that the image will occupy its container. The `handleChange` function is the function that is called when a change event occurs in the input.

## Previewing the image

At this point, we're just setting the `imageFile` state when a change event occurs but we're not providing any preview to our user. To achieve the desired image preview, we'll utilize the `FileReader` API and React's `useEffect` hook.

<Alert>
  To learn more about the FileReader API go to
  <LinkInPage
    href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader'
    text='this link from MDN'
  />.
</Alert>

```tsx title="ImagePreview.tsx" showLineNumbers {6-18}
import * as React from 'react';

const ImagePreview = () => {
  const [imageFile, setImageFile] = React.useState<File | null>(null);

  const [previewSrc, setPreviewSrc] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!imageFile) return;

    const reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onloadend = () => {
      setPreviewSrc(reader.result as string);
    };

    reader.readAsDataURL(imageFile);
  }, [imageFile]);

  // truncated
};
```

So what's happening here? 😅

First note that we introduced another state `previewSrc` to store the data url of the image file. Next, look at the `useEffect`. We instantiate a `FileReader` and we read the contents of the `imageFile` using the `readAsDataURL` method. We then assigned a callback to `reader.onloadend`. This event is fired when a file read has completed so this is where we set the value for the `previewSrc` state. The value of the previewSrc state will change as the imageFile is changed because imageFile is in the dependency array of the `useEffect`.

Now that our `previewSrc` can now have a value, we can assign it to the image's `src` like so:

```tsx showLineNumbers {2}
<img
  src={previewSrc}
  alt='a sample preview'
  width='100%'
  height='100%'
  style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}
/>
```

And just like that we can now have a preview of our selected image like the following:

![a sample uploaded image preview][pic2]

## Extracting a useImagePreview hook 🪝

Our solution works but it would be better if we can extract a custom hook out of it. This would be useful when we work on other projects that have image upload and preview functionality. So, let's extract our custom hook into a function called `useImagePreview`.

```tsx title="useImagePreview.ts" showLineNumbers
export default function useImagePreview(imageFile: File | null) {
  const [previewSrc, setPreviewSrc] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!imageFile) return;

    const reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onloadend = () => {
      setPreviewSrc(reader.result as string);
    };

    reader.readAsDataURL(imageFile);
  }, [imageFile]);

  return previewSrc;
}
```

We've just copied and pasted our implementation earlier. The only difference is that we're returning `previewSrc` and we're accepting an `imageFile` parameter. We use the custom hook as follows:

```tsx title="ImagePreview.tsx" showLineNumbers
const previewSrc = useImagePreview(imageFile);
```

One last improvement that we can do is to return a clean up function for the useEffect to avoid memory leaks.

```tsx title="useImagePreview.ts" showLineNumbers {15-17}
export default function useImagePreview(imageFile: File | null) {
  const [previewSrc, setPreviewSrc] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!imageFile) return;

    const reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onloadend = () => {
      setPreviewSrc(reader.result as string);
    };

    reader.readAsDataURL(imageFile);

    return () => {
      reader.abort();
    };
  }, [imageFile]);

  return previewSrc;
}
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging the FileReader API and React's useState and useEffect hooks, we are able to create a reusable hook that can help us give a preview of the image that our app users select from the file dialog. And, that's it!

Happy coding!
