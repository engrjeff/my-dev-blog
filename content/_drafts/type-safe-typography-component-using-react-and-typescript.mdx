## Introduction

Let's say you're given a frontend task. As part of the requirements, you must follow the design system which is included in the project mock-ups. The project requires you to render different pages which have many text elements with varying sizes and each should render a semantic HTML element.

Like this:

<TypographyExample />

Since you know React, your initial resolve might be to create a component for each variant of text in the design or perhaps you might be tempted to just simply render the necessary HTML element and throw in the necessary classes or styles in order for the text to look like what's in the design. That works until you think about reusability and maintainability, not to mention the so-called "clean code".

## Create a Typography Component!

As a React developer who faces this challenge, we'll create a type-safe Typography component. We aim to achieve the following objectives:

- We should be able to easily render the desired HTML element;
- The HTML element should determine the props that can be passed in the component;
- The component should be as type-safe as possible;
- We should be able to pass custom props to the component;
- We should be able to pass a `ref` to the component;

Woooh! ðŸ˜…. I know that's a lot to take in but I'll try my best to walk you through it. We're trying to achieve something like:

```tsx showLineNumbers
<Typography as='h2' variant='heading2' color='primary'>
  Primary
</Typography>
```

### Defining the Types

```tsx showLineNumbers
const Typography = <C extends TypographyElements = "span">(
  props: TypographyProps<C>
) => {
  const { as, children, color, variant, className, ...restProps } = props;

  const Component = as || "span";

  const classes = typography({ color, variant }, className);

  return (
    <Component className={classes} {...restProps}>
      {children}
    </Component>
  );
};
```
